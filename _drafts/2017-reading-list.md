title: 2017 reading list

I love reading.
However, paradoxically, I've never liked the *book*, particularly holding a book and reading it.
And while I spend most of my time on a laptop, I also don't like the concept of reading a novel on a laptop screen.

So it was a life-changer when I got my first Kindle in 2009.
Here was a device which was lightweight and allowed me to read books without a backlight shining into my eyes.
Since then, I've got maybe a hundred books (a mix of paid books from Amazon and free books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), but for the last few years I found I've been rereading books I've already read rather than finding new books to read.

For 2017, I resolved to read more books I haven't read before, and decided to keep track of the books I've read.
While I won't *exclusively* read new books (indeed, the first book of the year was a reread), I will be making an effort to include more books I haven't read before.

***[Ready Player One](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004J4WKUQ)*** by Ernest Cline (reread) -
Fun nostalgia-inducing story about a VR world where 1980s pop culture is on full display.
This book actually once helped me get a date with a pop culture geek girl; we were pretty sure we were the only two people in town who had read it at the time.
A movie adaptation is due out in 2018, and while normally I tend to be disappointed by movie/TV adaptations of books I've already read, I've got high hopes for this, as the plot lends itself well to translation to a CGI blockbuster format.

***[Flanigan: Anatomy of a Railroad Ghost Town](https://www.amazon.com/Flanigan-Anatomy-Railroad-Ghost-Town/dp/9997579321)*** by Eric N. Moody (physical) -
In 2015, I bought 10 acres of desert land near Pyramid Lake, about 5 miles from the ghost town of Flanigan, Nevada.
Not much was known about Flanigan, so I went about gathering as much information as I could about the area, ultimately resulting in writing the [Wikipedia article on Flanigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanigan,_Nevada).
Turns out this book, published in 1985, is the only comprehensive source of the history of Flanigan.
I originally bought it and had skimmed it many times for information, but this was the first time I read it cover to cover.

***[Edge Effects](https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Effects-Robert-D-Temple-ebook/dp/B007M5POKM)*** by Robert D. Temple (aborted) -
Another book I bought because it (briefly) mentioned Flanigan.
An interesting concept, it chronicles the border towns across the United States which are portmanteaus of the states they border -- for example, [Calneva, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calneva,_California), on the border of California and Nevada (and close to Flanigan).
Unfortunately, I didn't get into the writing style combined with areas I wasn't familiar with (the book starts on the east coast and moves westward), so I put it down after a few chapters.

***[Roughing It](https://www.amazon.com/Roughing-Mark-Twain-ebook/dp/B004SQTBIE)*** by Mark Twain -
On the other hand, I really got into this book, as it details Twain's journeys through the 19th century West (much of which in the Nevada Territory), and his style of humor, although dated, is very catchy.
It should be noted that, fitting the period, there is a fair amount of racism, mostly against Native Americans, with an entire chapter devoted to the laziness of a particular tribe.
