I bought a 160GB HD from compusa (only $60 after about 20 mail-in rebates!), and a 3.5" USB2 enclosure. The real gem is an instruction sheet for the enclosure, written in the best Engrish I have ever seen. I'll need to find a scanner, but here is the text:

HDD Assembles Elucidation

1. Make an effort to press in the direction that arrowhead point the plastics lock button up, such as picture A

2. Heading up the upper cover to turn over to rise, such as picture B

3. Cover up and down to separate then and completely, such as picture C

Is good with machine plank according to the right method conjunction the hard dish, lock the tight and HDD, cover the upper cover, can immediately trust the usage.
