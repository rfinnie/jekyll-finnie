[Go here, now.](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/) It's legit; it's run by the same cabal (Equifax/Experian/TransUnion) that runs [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/). (Which, by the way, is the ONLY legitimate "free" credit report site. The others, like freecreditreport.com are essentially scams where they sign you up for a "service" that bills your credit card after 30 days, and the only way you can avoid getting your card charged is by canceling between the 25th and 29th days.)

I've also heard good things about [Green Dimes](http://www.greendimes.com/) (which is apparently called Tonic now) for general purpose junk mail removal, but I have not had any experience with it.
