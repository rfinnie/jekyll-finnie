I now own a 1.25GHz/256MB Mac Mini. Got a sweet deal too. That now makes 4 mac machines I own, technically:

* Beige G3 "Server" with like 4 SCSI disks that equal about 2GB, hasn't been powered on in years
  
* Beige G3 tower, no hard drive currently, but I may install OS9 (and BootX so I can run linux on it, as it's OldWorld) that came with the mini
  
* 400MHz Graphite G4 AGP, debian installed, currently doing Finnix development
  
* 1.25GHz G4 Mini, dual-booting Tiger and debian, Finnix development will eventually be moved here
