Today I hooked up my cable line to my TV to see if clear QAM is still available on my account (it is), due to wanting to watch today's NFL game on CBS, since the owner of the local CBS station (KTVN) and Dish Network are currently in the middle of a bitter dispute, and KTVN is currently not available on Dish.

After the game, I spent some time poking around, figuring out which channel was which by cross-referencing guide data. I've compiled a complete list of clear QAM channels on Charter, as well as the channel ID map to the Zap2It guide list. I used to do this when I had a Windows Media Center with an HDHomeRun; hopefully it'll be useful to others.

This list is current as for 2011-12-22, and is subject to change. Also, if you can figure out what Charter Digital channel the ShopNBC channel maps to, let me know so I can update it. It was the only channel I wasn't able to figure out.

**Update (2011-12-22):** The major network stations have moved to their "traditional" locations. They also have Charter-provided descriptive IDs in the form KXXX_HD. I'm not sure if they're doing ATSC-style virtual remapping from their old QAM locations (and my TV isn't telling me), or perhaps they've gone all digital and have actually moved them down into the lower channels. Either seems likely. I've retained the old QAM channel, just in case they are virtual remaps. Also, KRNSCA (CW), QVC and TBSP have appeared on the 78 channel.
