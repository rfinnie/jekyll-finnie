Here's another one from the family cookbook. The shrimp is great, but I've got to say that the cracker mixture is where it's at. I could simply munch on that if I had to.

Ingredients:
  
* 1 lb shrimp, peeled and de-veined (cooked is fine)
  
* 8 oz (2 sticks) Ritz crackers
  
* 12 tbsp (1 1/2 sticks) melted butter
  
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
  
* 4 tbsp white wine
  
* 2 tsp worcestershire sauce
  
* 2 tbsp chopped parsley

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix the butter, lemon juice, wine, worcestershire sauce, and parsley together. Crumble the crackers in a large work bowl, integrate the wet ingredients, and mix half of the shrimp in. Layer the rest of the shrimp on a 8x8" pan, and distribute the cracker mixture on top of the shrimp bed. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes.

If, like me, you do not go through enough white wine to use a little in cooking, I've found that 2 tbsp gin works equally well.
