I have removed all Google ads from finnie.org, after logging into my AdSense account and noticing the money it brought in last month.

$0.02. Two cents. Interestingly, on zero clicks. (Pity payment?)

Meanwhile, [velociraptors.info](http://www.velociraptors.info/) brought in $79.15, and is now result #6 on Google for "velociraptor". That's above even any of [the](http://xkcd.com/87/) [Xkcd](http://xkcd.com/135/) [comics](http://xkcd.com/155/) which velociraptors.info parodies. Yeah, not removing ads on that.
