[<img src="http://www.hampr.com/images/hampr-ss-mobile-webkit-sm.png" alt="Hampr Mobile screenshot" style="float: right; margin: 1em;" />](http://www.hampr.com/images/hampr-ss-mobile-webkit.png)Two years ago, an "iPhone" version of the Hampr web interface was released, optimized for the iPhone web browser. Well, here we are in The Future, and the same interface works equally well on many WebKit-based mobile browsers. The Hampr Mobile interface has been tested on:

  * iPhone (all versions)
  * Android 1.6 & 2.0 (including T-Mobile G1, Droid, and the upcoming Google Nexus One)
  * Palm Pre/Pixi (and presumably future WebOS-based mobile phones)

In light of this, the interface is now available a <https://www.hampr.com/mobile/webkit> (the old URL, <https://www.hampr.com/iphone>, will continue to work). When you log into <https://www.hampr.com/>, the mobile link at the bottom-right corner of the page will be customized according to what mobile device it detects ("iPhone Version", "Android Version", etc), but the interface itself is the same for all WebKit-based mobile devices.

All phones listed above allow you to bookmark the Hampr Mobile interface and save the bookmark on your home screen. No "App" needed! And of course, while on the desktop, be sure to download the [Hampr Firefox extension](https://www.hampr.com/firefoxextension).
