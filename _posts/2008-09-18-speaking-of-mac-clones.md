[Psystar](http://www.psystar.com/), the company currently famous for butting heads with Apple, is shipping [Finnix](http://www.finnix.org/). [No, really.](http://www.psystar.com/opencomputing_leopard_restore_disk_.html) Looks like they're shipping it as a restore utility CD (which is great, since that's what Finnix is designed to be).
