As you know, June is National CVS Revision Conflict Awareness Month. Each year, over 2 million people suffer from CRC, a condition experienced when 2 developers check in conflicting code revisions. But with your help, we can eliminate CRC in our lifetime!

We still have to pick a ribbon to symbolize CRC awareness. All colors in the visible spectrum have already been taken by other groups, so I'm thinking something towards the infrared. Suggestions?
