OK, I love hot sauce, specifically Frank's RedHot Sauce. Despite the name, Frank's isn't the hottest sauce out there (it's not nearly as hot as Tabasco), but makes up for its lack of heat by being very flavorful and tasty. I use it on Subway sandwiches (they used to have a Buffalo Chicken sandwich, which was made with Frank's sauce and ranch sauce, but discontinued it), regular sandwiches, pizza, etc, etc. Recently, I thought, "wait, I use Frank's on top of pizza, why not make a pizza with Frank's as the base?"

Today, I did such a thing, in one of the rare instance where I take a bunch of raw ingredients and combine them. I think the experts call it "cooking". Included below is an illustrated recipe documenting this achievement.

<!--more-->Ingredients:


  
1 Dough or Crust or Something(TM)
  
1/2 cup Frank's RedHot sauce(TM) (using 1/2 cup of something hotter such as Tabasco is probably a rather bad idea)
  
1/4 cup butter or margarine
  
1/4 cup parmesan cheese
  
2 tbsp flour (for thickening)
  
mozzarella cheese
  
pepperoni
  
other stuff

Instructions:

Prepare your Dough or Crust or Something(TM) according to instructions. Some people have been known to make crust by combining flour and other stuff. Me? I bought a pre-made Boboli crust. If you are going that route as well, you may want to throw it up in the air while spinning it.

It may help to remove it from the package first.

(By the way, to all you camwhores out there, I took this picture with the assistance from a little device called a "tripod". It lets you take pictures of yourself that don't have I-Have-A-Huge-Arm-Reaching-Out-Toward-The-Camera Syndrome.)

Next, melt the butter (I used margarine, which is fine) and add the Frank's RedHot sauce(TM). Evenly stir in the parmesan cheese, then the flour. Cover and refrigerate for about 15 minutes.

Place the crust on a pan, cooking stone, etc.

Evenly spread sauce on the crust.

Add mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, then a little more mozzarella cheese to make it look cool. If you want to add other stuff, now's the time.

Now, bake the sucka. Question: It's hot outside, the entire week has been nothing but record breaking temperatures, your AC is broken, and it's 86F in your apartment. What do you do?

Answer: That's right! Break out the open-air pizza oven! The thing does work well though. I was looking at about a 10 minute bake time.

Slice 'er up and serve.

Mission accomplished! Replacing tomato sauce with hot sauce sauce proved to be a rather tasty gamble.
