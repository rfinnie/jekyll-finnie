I've been cleaning and organizing a lot in the last few weeks. My home office used to be a series of folding tables, a wire rack for computers, a stack of sorted plastic bins in the closet which hadn't been sorted INTO in years, and a stack of moving boxes with various junk from 1-3 moves ago. Today I have a corner IKEA desk and monitor cart to replace the folding tables, all of the moving boxes have been sorted into the plastic bins, and you can actually see the carpet.

I threw away a lot (for example, a circa 2000 VCR; it weighed less than a pound and was nearly all plastic, I don't remember buying it, I don't have any VHS tapes, and no donation centers would take it), donated a file cabinet to Goodwill, and donated 8 computers and 4 old rackmount hubs/switches to [New2u Computers](http://www.new2ucomputers.com/). Basically any 686-class desktop that wasn't currently in use got donated. (Actual conversation: "Surely you mean '686 or older'." "No, I'm keeping the 586 and 486, and any non-x86 computers.")

However, today I went to the UNR surplus sale, and walked out with a Blue & White G3 PowerMac for $5. It works fine; it has no OS, but as soon as I got home I booted a dev build of [Finnix](http://www.finnix.org/) running Linux 3.0-rc4. It even has a Zip drive.

So my desktop collection is currently:

  1. Athlon64 3400+ system (Linux router)
  2. Core 2 Duo E6550 system (Linux workstation)
  3. Core 2 Quad Q9300 system (Windows gaming machine)
  4. Core 2 Duo E7200 system (Finnix x86 dev)
  5. AMD K6 586-class system
  6. Cyrix 486-DX2 system
  7. Mac Mini G4 (Finnix PowerPC dev)
  8. PowerMac G4 MDD (Windtunnel)
  9. PowerMac G3 Blue & White
 10. PowerMac G3 Beige tower
 11. PowerMac G3 Beige server
 12. Linksys NSLU2
 13. Sun Ultra1
 14. Sun Blade 100
 15. SGI Challenge S
 16. Cobalt RaQ 2
