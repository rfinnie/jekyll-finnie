Since I have proven over and over again I am incapable of logging into Facebook more than once every few weeks, and since Facebook has completed its quest of taking over the world, I have decided to install some space-age software to automatically post blog updates to the appropriate Facebook pages:

  * [My blog](https://www.finnie.org/) to [my Facebook profile](http://www.facebook.com/rfinnie)
  * [Finnix blog](https://blog.finnix.org/) to [the Finnix page on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/FinnixCD)
  * [Velociraptor Aerospace Dynamics](http://www.velociraptors.info/vad) does not have a dedicated blog, but I occasionally post about it on my blog, and will be sure to share the posts with [the VAD page on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/VADSolutions)
