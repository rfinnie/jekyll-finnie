On April 27, 1997, I registered [finnie.org](https://www.finnie.org/).  I was in high school at the time, had a part-time job doing tech support at a dial-up ISP, and had saved up $70 for a domain registration.  This was before the decentralization of domain registrars, so InterNIC / Network Solutions was the only source for .com/.net/.org domains.  They charged $35 per year at the time, with the first two years prepaid.

I had actually planned on registering finnie.com, but had found I was too late, and someone else had just registered it.  (WHOIS says February 1997, but I seem to remember it was a few weeks earlier in April.)

As a gift to finnie.org and all it has provided... I've renewed it for another 3 years, at $15 per year.  It can also have my copy of *[The Complete Linux Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Linux-Kit-Daniel-Tauber/dp/0782116698)*, my first book on Linux from 1995 (which I still own -- complete with Slackware CD).
