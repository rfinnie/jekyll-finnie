[2ping](https://www.finnie.org/software/2ping/) 1.0 has been released! While the changes to the previous version are minor, this signifies a major milestone: 2ping (and the 2ping protocol) is now deemed "stable".

  * Protocol now "finished", 2ping is now "stable"!
  * Removed the sample initscript
  * Small Makefile and documentation changes

2ping 1.0 is compatible with the previous version, 0.9.1. And now that 2ping 1.0 has been released, it is expected that future versions of 2ping (as well as other future software that may implement the open source 2ping protocol) will interoperate with it.

Please [download 2ping 1.0](https://www.finnie.org/software/2ping/) and give it a try, thanks.
