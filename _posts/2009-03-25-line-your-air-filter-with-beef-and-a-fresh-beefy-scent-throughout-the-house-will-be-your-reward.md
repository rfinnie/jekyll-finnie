Actually, I'm making beef jerky, according to [this recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/beef-jerky-recipe/index.html) (halved, 1 pound of beef). The beef is chilled, cut into thin, long slices, marinated, and placed on accordion furnace filters. A blank filter is placed on top, and the whole thing is bungee corded to a box fan. Here's the final setup, before being placed on my patio:

For the record, the filters are cellulose/poly air filters, not fiberglass. They ran me about $7.50 for a 3-pack, and obviously aren't usable as furnace filters after they're used to make jerky. But they should be reusable for future jerky batches.

I'll let you know how they turn out when they're done tomorrow.
