title: Hoo boy, did I spend money today.
---
Today I grabbed my ankles and ordered a [ThinkPad T60 14"](http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2767):
   
* Intel Core 2 Duo processor T5500 (1.66GHz, 2MB L2, 667MHz FSB)
   
* Genuine Windows XP Home Edition _(yeah, Debian is going on it first chance I get)_
   
* 14.1 XGA TFT
   
* Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950 w/o WWAN
   
* 1 GB PC2-5300 DDR2 SDRAM 667MHz SODIMM Memory (1 DIMM)
   
* No integrated fingerprint reader
   
* 80GB Hard Disk Drive, 5400rpm
   
* CD-RW/DVD-ROM Combo 24X/24X/24X/8X Max, Ultrabay Slim
   
* Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG
   
* 6 cell Li-Ion Battery
   
* 1 Year Limited Warranty
   
* 3 Year Depot Upgrade with 3 Year ThinkPad Protection

Total damage: $1,556.23. By far the most expensive I've spent for a laptop, but that may explain why laptops only last about a year for me. I figured if I'm going to do this, I may as well do it _right_.

I also spent almost $250 buying a ticket for Burning Man. Insert hippie joke here.
