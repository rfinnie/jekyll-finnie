My [keyboard](http://store1.yimg.com/I/pckeyboards_1838_1050272) arrived today, and it is kickass. I forgot how good it feels typing on a buckling spring keyboard, as opposed to those $10 cheap rubber dome models. I thought about leaving it at work, but current office etiquette says that "clicka clicka clicka" is a Bad Thing(TM).

The serial number sticker say this keyboard was manufactured the day it shipped out, that is to say, last wednesday. One of the advantages of buying direct from the manufacturer...

Also, I'm currently recording a phone post of me typing in this post. Yes, I'm [simulcasting my livejournal post](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fo0bar/107211.html).

I know it's weird to be swooning over a keyboard, but if you google for [Model M](http://www.google.com/search?&q=model%20m), you'll see I'm not alone.
