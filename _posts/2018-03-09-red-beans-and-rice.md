title: Red Beans and Rice
---
Just a short post here (and no pictures, because let's be honest, red beans and rice doesn't actually look that appetizing once it's been reduced down to a brown mush).  Every few weeks I'll stop by Popeyes -- I love their spicy chicken strips with buffalo sauce -- and will get red beans and rice as a side.  A few weeks ago I decided to try to recreate the recipe, mostly by staring into the spice rack, picking a random spice and thinking "yeah, that'll work".

After a few iterations, I've got a recipe which is not 100% exact to Popeyes, but is still wonderfully tasty.  And as usual, is easy to make with pantry items.  (You could of course do things like use real celery instead of flakes, add salt pork or shrimp, etc, but this is a good simple base.)

* 4 cans (approx 15 oz each) red kidney beans, drained
* 1 can beef broth
* ½ can water
* 1 chicken bouillon cube
* 2 tsp celery flakes
* 2 tsp parsley flakes
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* ½ tsp onion powder
* ½ tsp crushed red pepper
* ¼ tsp cumin

Combine all ingredients, cover and bring to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer for 30 minutes, stirring halfway.  Uncover, remove bay leaves and mash moderately (most but not all beans should be broken).  Leave uncovered, re-add bay leaves and simmer for another 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.  Consistency should be a thick sauce.  Remove bay leaves.  Serve over rice.
