In celebration of [Bike to Work Day](http://www.sfbike.org/?btwd), last Thursday I bought a new bike. However I wasn't actually able to bike to work on Bike to Work Day (I was on call and needed to haul some equipment that day).

The last time I bought a bike was in 2002; a $30 bike from Target. I rode it a little, but in general I got exactly what I paid for, and its main use became a Burning Man bike. Moving to the top of a big hill in 2004 didn't help matters. But now I live closer to work (and more importantly, it's a relatively flat ride to work), and, inspired by [pdx6](http://www.livejournal.com/users/pdx6){.lj-user}'s [post](http://pdx6.livejournal.com/400457.html), I dusted off the bike and saw if I could make it to work and back (this was at about 10PM, mind you). I could, but my body didn't like me for it.

However, I did feel like I could do better with A) more exercise, and B) a better bike, particularly one with a seat that wouldn't kill my butt. After a little research and a few recommendations (all conflicting of course; the bike community are basically as vocal and opinionated as Linux nerds, see [jwz](http://www.livejournal.com/users/jwz){.lj-user}'s [post on the matter](http://jwz.livejournal.com/883988.html)), I bought a [2008 Giant Sedona aluminum](http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-us/bikes/lifestyle/1277/29341/ma) from [High Sierra Cycling](http://highsierracycling.com/).

After a weekend of breaking it in, the difference between the old Target bike and the Giant is like night and day. So on Sunday afternoon I took the plunge and tested riding to work during the day. I still ache and was a lot more winded from the heat (about 95F), but it was definitely a better ride, especially in the posterior region, if you know what I mean.

Oh, BTW, it's about a 5 mile route from my home to work, each way. [Here's the route I take.](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=10112085948171656454,39.473534,-119.799550%3B5787440814011725251,39.467320,-119.781467%3B2710272381553396005,39.459177,-119.775419%3B13726873054563493171,39.441890,-119.762150&saddr=4959+Talbot+Ln,+Reno,+NV+89509&daddr=Sierra+Rose+Dr+%4039.473534,+-119.799550+to:39.466746,-119.7896+to:Campus+Way+%4039.467320,+-119.781467+to:Colbert+Dr+%4039.459177,+-119.775419+to:Gateway+Dr+%4039.441890,+-119.762150+to:10315+Professional+Cir,+Reno,+NV+89521&mra=dpe&mrcr=0&mrsp=2&sz=14&via=1,2,3,4,5&sll=39.473173,-119.79003&sspn=0.027032,0.058365&ie=UTF8&ll=39.456342,-119.772263&spn=0.054077,0.11673&t=p&z=13)

Now, I just have to keep this up. I won't be riding tomorrow, since I need to drive (ugh) more equipment downtown tomorrow morning, but I plan to ride to work Tuesday. The day of rest should be good.
