Let us list all the eyebrow-raising points raised by this item in Dell's accessories store: [Panasonic KX-P2023 printer B/W dotmatrix Parallel](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?sku=650037-4&cs=04&c=us&l=en&dgc=SS&cid=27722&lid=628335)

  1. Companies are still selling dot matrix printers.
  2. _Dell_ is still selling dot matrix printers.
  3. I actually own that exact model dot matrix printer.
  4. I bought it in 1992. Therefore...
  5. Dell is selling a dot matrix printer that is at least 17 years old.
  6. While it was part of a bundle deal (with a Packard Bell Legend 486SX computer), I seem to remember it by itself costing no more than $100. So it has actually increased in price over the last 17 years.
