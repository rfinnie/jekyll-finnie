[4.8 close to Truckee](http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Quakes/nc51161673.htm); I felt it in Reno.

It was exciting and disappointing at the same time. Despite living in the bay area for a few years, I never felt one. (A big one in Napa I was out of town for, and one in San Jose I slept through.) I didn't hear a rumbling. It felt like the house was on conveyor rollers, and someone was rocking the house back and forth.
