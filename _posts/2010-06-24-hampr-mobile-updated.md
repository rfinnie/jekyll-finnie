[Hampr Mobile](https://www.hampr.com/mobile/webkit), the [Hampr](https://www.hampr.com/) interface designed for WebKit-based mobile phone browsers (iPhone, Android, WebOS) has received a facelift today. Text has been updated to look better on the higher resolution of the new iPhone 4 released today (while looking just as well as it did before on other phones' browsers), and the theme has been prettied up, with a new brushed metal theme. Some new iPhone-specific options have been added. If you add Hampr Mobile to your home screen (press the "+" sign at the bottom, then select "Add to Home Screen"), a new, high-resolution icon is added that is iPhone 4 compatible.
