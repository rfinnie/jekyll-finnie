On March 9, I bought 10 shares of [SPY](http://www.google.com/finance?q=SPY), an ETF that mimics the S&P 500. ETFs are also available that track the Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DIA](http://www.google.com/finance?q=DIA)) and the NASDAQ-100 ([QQQQ](http://www.google.com/finance?q=QQQQ)). Essentially, these stocks allow you to invest in the stock market index's progress without investing in individual stocks which have higher individual risks than the stock market as a whole. Anyway, I did this mostly because I believed that the market would eventually recover, and it would help even off the loss I've seen from the 10 shares of SPY that I bought in 2002.

Little did I know how right I was. March 9, 2009 was the exact day the S&P 500 hit its 10-year low. Go me.
