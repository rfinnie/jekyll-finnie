I have [created a blawg](http://www.finnix.org/blog/) for stuff related to Finnix development. The LJ RSS feed is [finnix](http://www.livejournal.com/users/finnix){.lj-user}, but LJ hasn't updated it yet. In the mean time, read the [first entry created so far](http://www.finnix.org/blog/2006/01/06/862-coming-soon/). I will probably continue to post info about releases on my personal LJ account, but the boring details will be on the blawg instead.
