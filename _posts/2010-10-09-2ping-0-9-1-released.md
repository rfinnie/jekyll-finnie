[2ping](https://www.finnie.org/software/2ping/) 0.9.1 has been released, with the following fixes and improvements:

  * Version bumped to 0.9.1 to signify a stable standardization is close
  * Changed the default UDP port from 58277 to 15998 (IANA-registered port)
  * Host processing latency is now subtracted where possible (protocol extension, backwards compatible)
  * Minor code cleanup
  * 0.9.0 (unreleased) was a Brown Paper Bag commit; typo in ChangeLog fixed

2ping 0.9.1 is compatible with 0.0.3 at a protocol level, though of course the default UDP port has been changed from 58277 to 15998 following IANA's assignment.

Also, 2ping development is now being managed with git, and a public copy is available at [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/2ping/2ping). Patches are welcome!

Please [download 2ping 0.9.1](https://www.finnie.org/software/2ping/) and give it a try, thanks.
