Occasionally, I post answers for the [Internet Oracle](http://cgi.cs.indiana.edu/~oracle/index.cgi), but unfortunately, I have yet to have any of my answers selected for the [digest](http://cgi.cs.indiana.edu/~oracle/digests.cgi). This recent one I was quite proud of:

**Supplication:**
  
<tt>I'm having trouble remembering the answers you've supplied for most of my last 58 supplications. Can you give me some hints?</tt>

**Response:**
  
<tt>1) Yes.<br /> 2) Chile.<br /> 3) I really wouldn't trust a chainsaw-weilding midget.<br /> 4) I told you not to trust that midget. You may want to go to an ER now.<br /> 5) Sorry, the Oracle is sleepy now. Ask again tomorow.<br /> 6) You can't go wrong with Spamburgers(TM).<br /> 7) ... and that's how asbestos-laced panties saved Spring Break.<br /> 8) The Kia Sorento is best in its class for performance, features and safety.<br /> 9) A rooster, a 9-volt battery, and plenty of blue duct tape.<br /> 10) Why yes, my refrigerator is running.<br /> 11) I'm sorry, to answer that question, I must charge you a $100/hour consulting rate.<br /> 12) Yet if you were to shoot him, YOU'D be the one going to jail. Pity.<br /> 13) That scene was in the Girls Gone Wild series. Specifically, GGW Road Trip to Sioux City Volume 6.<br /> 14) Neutered puppies.</p> 

<p>
  (Answers 15 though 55 were destroyed by hurricane Ivan.)
</p>

<p>
  56) Purple boxers.<br /> 57) Yes, I like them very much.<br /> 58) I assumed you mean "my last 58 supplications, not counting the one I am writing now." Otherwise, I would have to begin all over again, and this response would turn into an endless loop, destroying the space-time continuum in the process.

<p>
  You owe the Oracle a VHS tape of any of the 67 "Family Ties" clip shows.</tt>
